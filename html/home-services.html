By demonstrating our loyalty and dedication to our clients and our willingness to put our clients’ needs ahead of corporate needs (see Culture & Values), we believe that we will attract the kind of employees we want, and the kinds of clients we want.</p>
						 <p>Our goal is not to become the next large consultancy. Sure, we want sustainable long term growth, but it needs to be bounded to maintain the quality of our culture, and the quality of our staff. We will not become a “butts in seats” beltway bandit contractor. We want more, and we want people who want more from their company.</p>
						 <p>We want employee referrals to be the leading cause of hiring within our company. We want client referrals and requests to drive our contract growth.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="col-md-12">
                <ol class="service-list list-unstyled">
                    <li class="wow fadeInUp"><strong>The Client’s Needs are More Important than the Company’s</strong></br>You want to make a difference for your client. If you didn’t, you wouldn’t be looking at this company. We firmly believe that in the long run, putting our clients’ interests first is in our best interest. Whenever the two are in conflict, the clients’ interests win.</li>
                    <li class="wow fadeInUp"><strong>Amazing Talent Should Be Recognized</strong></br> We value contribution over title, and impact over talk. We are an action oriented company, a group of “doers” who act first. Sure, sometimes that means we make mistakes. But we prefer mistakes to inaction. We trust the people we hire, and we want you to make things happen. We’ll provide you as much as you need, and help if you ask. But we won’t be mad that you went off and tried to make some awesome happen on your own.</li>
                    <li class="wow fadeInUp"><strong>The Company Should Stay Out of Your Way</strong></br> We believe that the best employees don’t need management. They need to be put into a position where they can make a difference, and set free to make magic happen. We pride ourselves on bringing together talented teams of amazing people. Once that is done, our job is to get out of the way.</li>
					<li class="wow fadeInUp"><strong>It’s Boring When You’re Not Growing</strong></br> We know that your growth is important to retention, happiness, and ultimately customer satisfaction! We want you to continue to seek knowledge and skills that align with our opportunities and our client’s needs. We support professional development through training, conferences, and tuition assistance.</li>
					<li class="wow fadeInUp"><strong>You Should Get Credit for Bringing Home the Bacon</strong></br> Our policy hasn’t been fully documented, but a key aspect of our value system is recognizing the contributions of our team. If you’re responsible for bringing on a new client, adding new awesome staff, or otherwise responsible for generating new profits for the company, you deserve a piece of that pie. You know you think so, but here at A3, we think so too. We also know that working at a small company is different from working at a large one, sometimes in scary ways. There is less “definition” around hierarchy and level within the organization. While this sometimes might feel like there are less avenues for advancement, the opposite is actually true. Our flat organization gives you the ability to get directly involved in growing the business, and reaping the rewards that follow!</li>
					<li class="wow fadeInUp"><strong>Creating Drama is an Antipattern</strong></br> We are bringing together an insanely competent group of people. People who don't need step by step guidance. We believe that these kinds of people hate drama - especially the imaginary and created kinds that exist in large companies. Office politics will not be tolerated. It is company policy to use imagination to solve customer problems - not to create drama in the office.</li>
					<li class="wow fadeInUp"><strong>You Only Live Once, so Let’s Have Some Fun Together</strong></br> We don't force our employees to attend company events, but we do believe that you will like the people you work with, and will want to bring your family into the fold. We sponsor events and activities to bring our team closer together and to share experiences, skills, and friendship.</li>

                            We're not kidding. Your health is important to us. Healthcare is a major concern to many people. In this era of rising costs, rising premiums, and profit maximization, healthcare costs are getting increasingly shared between employees and employers.</br></br>
							But we’re different, and we believe that your health is important. Without you, we wouldn’t have a company! So we get great healthcare, and we provide it free for you and your family (or at least, we will as soon as we can). Until then, we’ll reimburse your current healthcare at 100%, or help you to get individual coverage and cover that at 100% until we get our corporate plan.
